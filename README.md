# Java-Learning
This repository contains Java files that I have worked on whilst on my journey to learn Java. Feel free to take a look at some of the code.

## 1. File Directory
Each of the Java files in this repository are listed below along with a description of the file. The list will be updated as I add more Java files to the repository.

**ASCIIConvert.java** - Uses the ASCII codes of letters to convert them from lowercase to uppercase and vise-versa.

**CheckNumber.java** - Check to see if a number is ODD or EVEN.

**Circle.java** - Works out the area, circumference and diameter of a circle from a given radius.

**CompareValues.java** - Compares two integers and prints information about them.

**DoWhile.java** - Uses Logical AND along with a do-while loop.

**DrawOutlineOfBox.java** - Draws a box to the console using methods and loops.

**LargestNumber.java** - Prints the largest number from a list of numbers inputted.

**MultiplyNumber.java** - Multiply two inputted numbers and output the total.

**MultiplyNumbersBy3.java** - Multiplies an inputted number by 3 and outputs the total.

**Rectangle.java** - Works out the area and perimeter of a rectangle using the length and breadth values.

**ReverseNumbers.java** - Reverses the numbers stored in a integer. Eg: 1234 becomes 4321

**SwapNumbers.java** - Uses a temp variable to store a variable whilst it is replaced with a new variable.

**UsingVariables.java** - Learning and using char, int and double data types.

**ValuesOutput.java** - Takes input from the keyboard THREE integer values and enquires from the user if they wish to have the three values entered output in ascending or descending order. Warning: This is very badly coded.
