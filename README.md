# Java-Learning
This repository contains Java files that I have worked on whilst on my journey to learn Java. Feel free to take a look at some of the code. I mainly only work on this on Wednesdays during my University Course.

## 1. File Directory
Each of the Java files in this repository are listed below along with a description of the file. The list will be updated as I add more Java files to the repository.

**ASCIIConvert.java** - Uses the ASCII codes of letters to convert them from lowercase to uppercase and vise-versa.

**CheckNumber.java** - Check to see if a number is ODD or EVEN.

**Circle.java** - Works out the area, circumference and diameter of a circle from a given radius.

**CompareValues.java** - Compares two integers and prints information about them.

**DoWhile.java** - Uses a Logical AND along with a do-while loop.

**DrawOutlineOfBox.java** - Draws a box to the console using methods and loops.

**LargestNumber.java** - Prints the largest number from a list of numbers inputted.

**MultiplyNumber.java** - Multiply two inputted numbers and output the total.

**MultiplyNumbersBy3.java** - Multiplies an inputted number by 3 and outputs the total.

**Rectangle.java** - Works out the area and perimeter of a rectangle using the length and breadth values.

**ReverseNumbers.java** - Reverses the numbers stored in a integer. Eg: 1234 becomes 4321

**SwapNumbers.java** - Uses a temp variable to store a variable whilst it is replaced with a new variable.

**UsingVariables.java** - Learning and using char, int and double data types.

**ValuesOutput.java** - Takes input from the keyboard THREE integer values and enquires from the user if they wish to have the three values entered output in ascending or descending order. Warning: This is very badly coded.

## 2. MyProgrammingLabs
Each of the following Java files below have come from learning Java using the Introduction to Java Programming - 10th Edition Book.

**ComputeAndInterpretBMI.java** - Works out the BMI from the entered height and weight.

**ComputeAngles.java** - User enters the x and y coordinates of the three corner points in a triangle and then it displays the three angles.

**ComputeArea.java** - Computes the area using Pi.

**ComputeAreaWithConsoleInput.java** - Computes the area inputted to the console and calculates the area using Pi.

**ComputeAreaWithConstant.java** - Works out the area for the circle of radius using constant Pi.

**ComputeAverage.java** - Calculates the average of three numbers.

**ComputeChange.java** - Calculates the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies in a specified amount.

**ComputeExpression.java** - Examples of math expressions in Java.

**ComputeLoan.java** - Works out monthly payment and total payment of entered loan amount.

**ComputeTax.java** - Works out the tax amount from an entered amount and status.

**ScannerObject.java** - Using scanner object to take in different variables and values.

**ShowCurrentTime.java** - Works out and displays the current time.

**ShowLogicErrors.java** - Code will run with no runtime errors, but has a logical error which can not be detected by the compiler.

**ShowRuntimeErrors.java** - Code will not run due to runtime errors, which will show up in the compiler.

**SimpleIfDemo.java** - Code demo using IF statements.

**SubtractionQuiz.java** - User given two random numbers and asked for the answer. Response informing if answer is correct or incorrect.

**TestBooleanOperators.java** - Informs the user if a number is divisible by 2 and 3 - Testing the booleans.
